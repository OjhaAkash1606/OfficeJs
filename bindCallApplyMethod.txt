Call method - The call() method calls a function with a given this value and arguments 
              provided individually.
              
    // If function calls without any arguments

            -If function calls In strict mode without arguments, "this" keyword's value is "undefined".  

            -If it doesn't call in strict mode, "this" keyword takes value as global object and
                all primitive value will be converted to objects.  

    // If function calls with some arguments 

            -In call method, "this" keyword takes first argument as an value and rest as a para-meter 
            as a list of para-meter.

    // If function calls with "new" keyword
            
            -In call method, If function invoked by "new" keyword, this keyword creates new instance 
             of function.

  // Difference between apply and call method 

            -In call method rest parameter takes as a list and in apply method rest para-meter takes as
                an single array.

 // bind methods 
            -The bind() method creates a new function and that function is invoked after defined it.
