What is currying in JS?
    -currying is the technique of evaluating function with multiple arguments,
    into sequence of nesting function with single arguments.

    -when a function, instead of taking all arguments at once, takes the first one
     and returns a new function that takes  second one and returns a new function
     which takes the third one argument and so on until all arguments have
     been fulfilled.

What is composition in js?
    Function composition is an approach where the result of one function is passed 
    on to the next function, which is passed to another until the final function is 
    executed for the final result. 
    Function compositions can be composed of any number of functions.
