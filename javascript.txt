What is currying in JS?
    -currying is the technique of evaluating function with multiple arguments,
    into sequence of nesting function with single arguments.

    -when a function, instead of taking all arguments at once, takes the first one
     and returns a new function that takes  second one and returns a new function
     which takes the third one argument and so on until all arguments have
     been fulfilled.

What is composition in js?
    Function composition is an approach where the result of one function is passed 
    on to the next function, which is passed to another until the final function is 
    executed for the final result. 
    
    Function compositions can be composed of any number of functions.

    const compose = (...fns) => x => fns.reduce((y, f) => f(y), x);    



What is closures ?
    -A closure is a function having access to the parent scope.
    it preserve the data from outside

    -A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer
     function's variable.  
   
    -A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
     with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment)


What is reflect?
    -Reflection is the ability of the program to manipulate variables, properties
     and methods of objects at run time. 

     -Reflect is a global object that provides some useful static method for reflection.

     -these methods can be divided into two categories.
        Introspection methods - which are non-destructive methods
        modification methods - which are destructive methods


what is coalescing?
    -The nullish coalescing operator (??) is a logical operator that
     returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand
     is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand.


What is hoisting?
    -Hoisting is a by default behaviour of javascript which allowcats memory 
    of variable or function before executed.
